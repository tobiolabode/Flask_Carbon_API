# Flask_Carbon_API
An API developed to work out the about of emmissions produced when a shipment is fulliled.


API in python that will calculate emissions produced when shipping products around the world. I got this idea from a website called patch. 
The company offsets carbon by working out the emissions generated when shipping a product.

Please read the blog post of this project on my website.
