# Flask_Carbon_API
An API developed to work out the about of emmissions produced when a shipment is fulliled.


The API  will calculate emissions produced when shipping products around the world. I got this idea from a website called [patch](https://www.usepatch.com/). 
The company offsets carbon by working out the emissions generated when shipping a product.
